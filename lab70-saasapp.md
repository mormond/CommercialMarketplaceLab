# Publish a SaaS Application Offer

## Introduction

The *SaaS App Offer* differs from the *Virtual Machine Offer* and *Azure App Offer* as no resources are deployed in the customer subscription. As such, the publisher must charge both for the software licence and the underlying Azure resource costs used to deliver the solution. *SaaS App Offers* can be listed in both the *Azure Marketplace* and *AppSource*.

*SaaS App Offers* support the *Transact* listing type. They also support *Trial* and *Get it now (Free)* listing types. *Get it now* enables either free access or for the publisher to take control of the licence & billing relationship themselves. The *SaaS App Offer* is the only offer type to support a *Contact Me* listing. A *Test drive* option is also available.

Transact *SaaS App Offers* can be billed as either *flat rate* or *per user*. If *flat rate* is selected, this can optionally be combined with *metered billing* to provide greater billing flexibility. Both monthly and annual billing is available.

Each plan can be created with a free trial option giving you the option to offer customers a 1 month period free of charge.
